# DropRemote
Just a quick'n'dirty DSLR Remote I made for my Dad with an Arduino

Just open the DropRemote.ino file with the Arduino IDE and flash it to your Device.

You have to have the following things wired up as written below:

Photoresistor: A0
Potentiometer: A1
DSLR Cable (LED): 12
LED for emitting Light: 13

You can set the threshold for triggering the Shutter under "threshold"

If you have any problems with the delay of triggering the Remote/the LED, try setting the "PotiGut" variable as you need it.
