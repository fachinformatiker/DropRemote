# DropRemote
Just a quick'n'dirty **DSLR Remote I made for my Dad** with an Arduino for his **waterdrop pictures**.   :droplet:

Just open the DropRemote.ino file with the **Arduino IDE** and flash it to your Device.



You have to have the following things wired up as written below:

Device | Pin
----------------- | -------------------
Photoresistor | A0
Potentiometer | A1
DSLR Cable (LED for example) | 12
LED for emitting Light | 13

You can set the threshold for triggering the Shutter under "*threshold*"

If you have any problems with the delay of triggering the Remote/the LED, try setting the "*PotiGut*" variable as you need it.



Feel free to write my an e-mail: **info@sysop.top**  :speech_balloon:
